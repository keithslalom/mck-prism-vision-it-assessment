- Technical integration and data migration
- Regulatory compliance and governance
- Financial and business continuity
- Human resources and change management
- Vendor and third-party relationships

### Step 2: Risk Analysis

**Probability Assessment:**
1. **Historical Data:** Review similar integration experiences
2. **Expert Judgment:** Leverage domain expertise from clinical and technical teams
3. **Quantitative Analysis:** Where data is available, use statistical models
4. **Scenario Analysis:** Consider multiple potential outcomes

**Impact Assessment:**
1. **Financial Impact:** Direct costs, revenue loss, opportunity costs
2. **Operational Impact:** Workflow disruption, efficiency loss, service delays
3. **Clinical Impact:** Patient safety, care quality, provider satisfaction
4. **Regulatory Impact:** Compliance violations, penalties, reputational damage
5. **Strategic Impact:** Long-term business objectives, competitive position

### Step 3: Risk Evaluation

**Risk Tolerance Thresholds:**
- **Critical (9):** Requires immediate executive attention and emergency response
- **High (6):** Must be actively managed with detailed mitigation plans
- **Medium (3-4):** Regular monitoring with contingency plans prepared
