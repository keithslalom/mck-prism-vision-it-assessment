# Comprehensive IT Assessment Plan: McKesson-PRISM Vision Integration

**PRISM Vision Group IT Assessment & Integration Project Plan**  
*Post-Acquisition Technology Due Diligence and Integration Strategy*

## Executive Summary

Following McKesson's $850 million acquisition of 80% controlling interest in PRISM Vision Group (completed April 2025), this comprehensive IT assessment plan addresses the critical technology integration requirements for incorporating the East Coast's largest independent ophthalmology ASO into McKesson's U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. **The integration must achieve projected earnings accretion of $0.20-$0.30 in year one, scaling to $0.65-$0.75 by year three**, while maintaining clinical excellence across 91 locations and ensuring seamless healthcare service delivery.

The strategic rationale centers on extending McKesson's proven specialty practice platform model from oncology to ophthalmology, leveraging the company's Fortune 6 infrastructure to scale PRISM's 180+ provider network. **The assessment plan balances rapid value realization with risk mitigation**, ensuring HIPAA compliance, operational continuity, and physician satisfaction throughout the 18-month integration timeline.

## Context and Strategic Background

PRISM Vision Group represents a $850 million strategic investment expanding McKesson's specialty care portfolio into the high-growth ophthalmology market. With 91 office locations, 7 ambulatory surgery centers, and over 1,200 employees, PRISM operates the largest network of retina providers in the US. The acquisition follows McKesson's successful specialty consolidation playbook, previously demonstrated with the $2.49 billion Florida Cancer Specialists acquisition.

**McKesson's technology transformation context** includes an aggressive 5-year digital migration from 80% on-premise to cloud-first architecture, positioning the company to efficiently integrate PRISM's cloud-based Nextech EHR platform. The parent company's $687 million annual technology investment, zero-trust security implementation, and partnerships with Microsoft Azure and Okta create a robust foundation for specialty practice integration.
